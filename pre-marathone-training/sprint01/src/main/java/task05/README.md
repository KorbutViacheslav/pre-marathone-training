# Task 5

**A Point class, which models a 2D point with x and y coordinates should contains:**

- Two private instance variables x and y of int type.
- A constructor that constructs a point with the given x and y coordinates.
- A method getXYPair() which returns the x and y in a 2-element int array.
- A method called distance(int x, int y) that returns the distance from this point to another point at the given (x, y)
  coordinates.
- An overloaded distance(Point point) method that returns the distance from this point to the given Point instance.
- Another overloaded distance() method that returns the distance from this point to the origin (0, 0).
